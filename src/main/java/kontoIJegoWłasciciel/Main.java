    /*
    There are two classes: Account with three fields
    (code, balance, owner) and User with three fields
    (login, firstName, lastName). Both classes have
    parameterized constructors. See full declarations
    of these classes in the code template. Do not be
    afraid of the static keyword. It's not important now.
    In the main method, create an instance of the Account
    class and pass it to the process method by calling
    process(account). This method is already defined.
    The instance must have the following values of the
    fields:
    code: "123456",
    balance: 1000,
    owner: (login: "demo-user", firstName: "Alexander",
    lastName: "Schmidt").
    Note that the owner is an instance of the User class.
    See provided template, do not change it.
